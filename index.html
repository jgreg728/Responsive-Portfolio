    <p>Hey there! My name is John Gregorio. I'm a graduate from St. John's University with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing. I was born and raised in Staten Island, NY, and have been working at SHI International in Somerset, NJ as a Partner Marketing Specialist since January 2016.</p>

    <p>I love experiencing new places, meeting new people, and learning about new things. I also enjoy outings to Manhattan, as I can never get enough of everything the city has to offer. Other personal interests of mine include music, gaming (proud Nintendo fan), technology, travelling, and as of recently, coding! I'm a firm believer in having a hobby all your own, doing what you love and mastering your craft. </p>
